    <p>Dear eScholarship Editor/Administrator,</p>
    <p>This is your regular reminder that current usage statistics for the publication(s) you manage on
       <a href="https://escholarship.org">eScholarship</a> are always available via the link(s) below:</p>
    <ul>
      <% units.each do |unit| %>
        <li><a href="<%= unit.url %>/stats"><%= unit.name %></a></li>
      <% end %>
    </ul>
    <p>Additional information about these reports is available in our
      <a href="https://help.escholarship.org/support/solutions/folders/9000181583">help center</a>.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>eScholarship provides publication information to 
      <a href="https://help.escholarship.org/support/solutions/articles/9000133469">as many search and discovery services as possible</a>, since that is where most readers find eScholarship content. You also can increase readership by referring people to the URLs of your papers in eScholarship by using the SHARE button to share via Twitter, Facebook, email or by copying either the eScholarship URL or the DOI based URL, if your publication has one.</p>
    <p>Regards,<br/>
       The eScholarship Team<br/>
