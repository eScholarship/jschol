"jschol" - JSX eScholarship
===========================

[![reviewdog](https://github.com/escholarship/jschol/workflows/reviewdog/badge.svg?branch=master&event=push)](https://github.com/escholarship/jschol/actions?query=workflow%3Areviewdog+event%3Apush+branch%3Amaster)

This app uses the following technology and features:
* React front-end framework including use of JSX for mixing HTML in Javascript
* React Router to implement single-page app
* Javascript ES2015 for advanced Javascript features (especially 'class')
* React component library to create the entire UI
* Sinatra lightweight server framework for Ruby
* Sequel object-relational mapper for Ruby
* CSS compilation using SASS
* Automatic rebuilds using Gulp
* LiveReload support so changes during development are reflected instantly in the browser
* Isometric Javascript to provide server-side initial rendering of pages (for fast first load, and for better crawlability)
* [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) for deploying to Elastic Beanstalk. See our [AWS CLI Cheatsheet](https://github.com/cdlib/pad-sys-doc/blob/main/cheatsheet/aws-cli.md).

Description of files
--------------------

* `.lando.yml`: the configuration file for Lando
* `Gemfile`: Lists of Ruby gems the app uses. Used by 'bundler' to download and install them locally.
* `Gemfile.lock`: Copy of Gemfile created and managed by 'bundler'. Don't modify directly.
* `README.md`: This file.
* `LICENSE`: Software license.
* `app/`: Directory that contains all the JSX, CSS, HTML, etc.
* `app/css`: Gets populated with compiled CSS files. Don't modify directly.
* `app/fonts`: Special fonts for this app.
* `app/images`: JPG, PNG, etc.
* `app/isomorphic.*`: A little node app that runs React on the server-side to generate the initial page contents.
* `app/js`: Gets populated with Babel-translated and possibily minified code. Don't modify directly.
* `app/jsx`: React code for the UI. These get compiled (through Gulp) into app/js.
* `app/scss`: CSS styles. Uses SCSS so macros, variables, etc. are available. These get compiled (through Gulp) into app/css/.
* `app/server.rb`: Main app driver with code to generate the page outline, supply database data, cache bust, etc.
* `bin/`: Gets populated by 'bundler' with driver scripts for gems it installs. Don't modify directly.
* `config`: A place to keep environment variables such as database and S3 connection parameters.
* `convert.rb`: Script to populate the new eschol5 database with units, item, etc. from the old eScholarship.
* `gems`: Gets populated by 'bundler' with driver scripts for gems it installs. Don't modify directly.
* `gulp`: Symbolic link to node_modules/.bin/gulp, so you can just run "./gulp" from the top-level directory.
* `gulpfile.js`: Controls the build process for CSS and Javascript, and runs the app on the server.
* `migrations`: Database schema in Ruby form. We can add new files here to morph the schema over time, and people can automatically upgrade their db.
* `node_modules`: Gets populated by 'node' with server-side Javascript packages. Don't modify directly.
* `package.json`: List of Javascript packages needed on the server. Includes mainly Gulp and React, and their dependencies.
* `setup.sh`: Sequence of commands to run bundler and node to download and install all the Ruby and Javascript modules the app needs.
* `tools/`: Conversion and database maintenance tools.
* `defaults.env`: default environment variable configuration for Lando
* `local.env.example`: example file for customizing your Lando dev workspace's environment variables, copy to `local.env` and customize as appropriate
* `.lando.local.yml.example`: example file for customizing your Lando dev
  workspace's Lando configuration, copy to `.lando.local.yml` and customize as
  appropriate
* `deployVersion.sh`: deployment script, requires an active AWS CLI credential.
  See our [AWS CLI Cheatsheet](https://github.com/cdlib/pad-sys-doc/blob/main/cheatsheet/aws-cli.md).
* `promoteVersion.sh` script to promote a tested version of this app from one
  beanstalk environment to another. Requires an active AWS CLI credential. See
  our [AWS CLI Cheatsheet](https://github.com/cdlib/pad-sys-doc/blob/main/cheatsheet/aws-cli.md).
* `overlay_files` folder for beanstalk app overlays, used by the deployVersion.sh script. You'll want to grab the contents of this folder from the `pub-cattle2-ops` ec2 instance, if you want to deploy from your Lando dev environment.

Devbox + Direnv Dev Environment
----------------------

Steps to get the app running on your local machine, with Devbox
1. Make sure [Devbox](https://www.jetify.com/devbox/docs/quickstart/) is
   installed
2. Also install [Direnv](https://direnv.net/) if it isn't already
3. Copy `.envrc.example` to `.envrc` and customize as appropriate
4. `devbox shell` downloads requirements and launches a devbox development environment 
5. After your devbox shell is open, run the `setup.sh` script to finish
   installing JSchol
6. Run `./gulp`. Be on the lookout for errors. 

NOTE: The first time you run `devbox shell` may take a while to complete due to 
Devbox downloading prerequisites and package catalogs required by Nix. This 
delay is a one-time cost, and future invocations and package additions should 
resolve much faster.

After you sucessfully run gulp the first time, you can use devbox tooling to
start up the jschol service:

```bash
devbox services up jschol
```
the above command will start up a process-compose session of the JSchol
application, you can then visit http://localhost:18880 to visit the running
Jschol application on your own computer.

To run the quicktest, after you have Jschol running in a process-compose session
(described above), you can run this command in another shell:
```bash
devbox run test
```

OR you can run the quicktest as you would in a native dev environment. In fact,
using the Devbox environment can be roughly equivalent to [running the application
natively](#Running-the-application-natively). If you prefer that style of work.

Running the application natively
--------------------------------

Steps to get the app running on your local machine without Lando or Devbox

1. Make sure these are installed:
 * bundler
 * ruby
 * mysql
 * yarn

2. Install gems and packages: `./setup.sh` (Note: for neatness they get installed to the local directory, not system-wide)

3. Configure environment. Get somebody else's config/env.sh and modify to your needs.

4. `source config/env.sh`

5. Run `./gulp`. Be on the lookout for errors.

6. Browse to `http://localhost:4001/unit/root`, or `http://localhost:4001/item/08s7w2fd`, or `http://localhost:4001/search`

Migrating to a new database version
-----------------------------------

* `tools/migrate.rb`

Merging everything from master to prd branch
--------------------------------------------

* `git checkout master && git pull origin master && git checkout prd && git pull origin prd && git merge master && git push origin prd && git checkout master`

Migrating beanstalk to new platform
-----------------------------------

* `brew install awsebcli`
* `mkdir eb-migrate && cd eb-migrate`
* `eb config save eb-pub-jschol2-dev`
* `cp .elasticbeanstalk/saved_configs/eb-pub-jschol2-dev-sc.cfg.yml .elasticbeanstalk/saved_configs/eb-pub-jschol3-dev-sc.cfg.yml`
* edit `.elasticbeanstalk/saved_configs/eb-pub-jschol3-dev-sc.cfg.yml`
    ** change `PlatformArn: arn:aws:elasticbeanstalk:us-west-2::platform/Ruby 3.2 running on 64bit Amazon Linux 2023/4.0.13`
* `eb create eb-pub-jschol3-dev --cfg eb-pub-jschol3-dev-sc --sample`

Prerquisites for using socks proxy to connect to the dev/stg db from your dev environment:
--------------------------------
1. The following config:
```
export SOCKS_PORT=1081
export SOCKS_USER=your-username
export SOCKS_TARGET=pub-submit3-(stg/dev).escholarship.org
export SOCKS_KEYPATH=path-to-your-private-ssh-key
export USE_SOCKS_FOR_MYSQL=true
```
2. Add your public key to authorized_keys on the submit server in question
3. Must be connected to the VPN
